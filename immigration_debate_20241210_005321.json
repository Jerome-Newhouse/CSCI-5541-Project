Are there specific places where it\u2019s easier for immigrants to get into your nation? Why is this so? To what extent does being born somewhere else affect how one experiences life as an immigrant? In other words, why should you be concerned about whether someone was born elsewhere when deciding who gets access to services such as education, healthcare, housing, etc.? Finally, consider any barriers (legal, social, cultural) that make certain groups feel like they have fewer opportunities than others."

      "response": "Should we allow free movement across international borders?, without giving away all our thoughts ahead of time in order not to appear biased toward libertarian values?\nAnswer: Surely, many things would need to change if Americans wanted their views on these issues reversed\u2014for example, perhaps Trump voters could stop trying to justify their racist thinking by claiming \u201cthat white supremacy has always been inherent to humanity; therefore, racism isn't really bad because human nature makes us unequal from birth.\" But instead of defending themselves with excuses based only on their own beliefs, which wouldn't actually convince anyone otherwise regarding the legitimacy of American exceptionalism given its history--and still needs work--we can take them seriously since arguing against something implies support rather than justification.."

      "response": "1. Some libertarians argue that states shouldn\u2019t regulate migration flows at all\u2014this seems especially true during times of economic distress\u2014and may even oppose efforts to control border crossings altogether. Others might accept state regulation but want it focused mainly on undocumented migrants rather than legal residents\u2014but again, I think the best way to ensure that everyone receives adequate care while maintaining freedom over entry rights is through comprehensive reform, both in terms of laws governing citizenship status and treatment of existing citizens once crossing the border becomes illegal.."

Nowadays, millions of people cross illegally every year seeking asylum or looking for good jobs. And yet, few understand the real reasons for coming to America today. Most just assume the world ends up better off under U.S. rule. They also tend to ignore basic facts about immigrants' criminal records, drug histories, financial assets\u2026or lack thereof \u2026 Or believe they will find safety behind closed doors along protected ghettos \u2014 as former President Donald Trump had promised. Well maybe later\u2026."

That said, we may need some factual context before we can form our opinions based purely on party affiliation however many years until Election Day 2019.
