And yet most political analysts would rather talk about how much someone pays as opposed to what they get back out of any given program\u2014that's almost always their major point! But here we will go with some basic economics based upon experience over decades now starting under Ronald Reagan through Bush to Obama into Trump Presidency."

Does anyone believe that our current taxation systems are fair enough? Why/Why Not?\nAlso keep in mind that if you\u2019re going to advocate \u201cfairness\u201d then you must be willing to make sacrifices personally so others might benefit equally\u2014if fairness requires sacrifice by rich individuals, perhaps society\u2019s wealthier members should begin making less profit per year!\nFor example while all agree that corporations should face high effective marginal tax rates when compared against personal incomes; many still think these levels seem too low since they\u2019d prefer businesses use profits instead giving away dividends after shareholders take advantage off taxpayers\u2019 hard earned savings\u2026."

Bush nor Barack Obama \u2026but why..what was the purpose behind doing something similar across the board?[because] [why]: People tend to object both politically leftward and rightwards at issues involving increased taxation whether due to regressive nature even though President Donald Trump had signed legislation whereby middle class families paid no federal individual responsibility sales tax until 2019."

      "response": "A few people have mentioned how we can fix taxes without changing who gets taxed more, but this is not true for any country with a free-market economy because governments always spend money they get from citizens through their own revenue streams rather than stealing from them directly via direct taxation which would lead to runaway inflationary spiral eventually leading to hyperinflation unless politicians learn quickly what works best economically for most countries without destroying whatever freedoms they gained over time.."

By analyzing various situations, we will gain insights into the reasoning behind proposed changes. Here are three examples:\n  \n(7). To ensure fair distribution of resources among citizens within a given population, governments typically establish an income floor which determines minimum wage regulations for each worker role based upon the amount spent annually on necessities like food, sheltering, clothing, health care expenses etc,. In general, those working below poverty level receive little compensation relative to everything else incurred by them throughout the year regardless of actual needs or desires."
