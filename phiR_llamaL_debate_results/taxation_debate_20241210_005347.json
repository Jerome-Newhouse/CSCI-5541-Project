      "response": "Is it possible for American society as written today to support both universal healthcare coverage in America while still allowing for some form of private insurance industry based around healthy young individuals willing to purchase policies themselves rather then pooling money together into one fund from which each person receives treatment no matter what they do later in life??\nThis discussion does nothing more than take advantage of current political sentiment toward social policy issues like health care. I think there will always have been Americans concerned about government spending but never really thought deeply enough about whether our system actually works."

Do these changes change any existing problems regarding lack of affordable access across states because different areas can receive vastly different amounts funded depending upon their state size and population density...or perhaps immigration laws, since most undocumented immigrants work blue collar jobs anyway??? In other words...."

      "response": "1- How does an increased level of wealth translate into greater taxes paid by high incomes compared to low incomes? The U.S. economy is far too complex to make such generalizations without understanding every aspect of it including internal politics within Congress and individual member\u2019s personal financial situation. For example, why did Mitt Romney get elected when he had so many personal assets outside of his household\u2014his father owned several businesses\u2014and yet was taxed at a relatively low rate on his earnings? Why were Barack Obama\u2019s net worth before taking office less significant than John McCain during his eight years in Washington DC? These questions go beyond mere speculation though\u2014they involve real world facts that must inform decisions made now\u2014not future ones."

You may use statistics related specifically relating to middle classes which do report feeling burdened due to increasing levels of governmental regulation concerning business practices etc."
