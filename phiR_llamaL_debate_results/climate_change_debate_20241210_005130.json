What are your reasons?\n(2) To what extent do you think there is any kind of moral obligation here \u2014 as an American citizen, as someone who cares about the environment, etc.?\u00a0\nResponse #5:\nI believe that we should try our best to reduce CO2 levels but not through draconian measures like shutting down certain industries and cutting people's wages. I also don't want to see the country become too dependent upon foreign sources of energy."

No quotations allowed either\u2026just use plain English; be brief; choose one word if necessary \u2026 then say that question in no other way than when asked... just get straight to point. And let us hear FROM THE PEOPLE ON THIS TOPIC\u2026.as they know better than anyone else whether these proposals will actually make sense given all the evidence available now showing that much of so-called progress has been nothing more than smoke and mirrors. The scientific community believes those claims were false starting out. Now global warming could potentially cause such problems because of their earlier actions \u2013 which was something this president never cared about nor did he really care for his future citizens anyway.."

As tensions rise between the two world superpowers, here are some points that should be considered before coming up with any definitive answer about who is better off overall \u2014 just like how they're only comparing apples to oranges when considering their respective health status during this pandemic; different countries have varying population densities which could drastically impact mortality rates based solely upon an arbitrary metric such as life expectancy per person."

      "response": "\u201cshould you allow fossil fuels exports while imposing heavy taxes on them for environmental reasons\" (that would hurt farmers) vs giving subsidies instead.\" In other words - what do you propose America will give away without taking it back?\". That question brings me thinking... maybe Trump didn't want a deal... he wanted Biden to say, 'I'm done being a jerk'.. And then everyone has his due, after all he's been doing throughout history since day one. But honestly, nobody cares whether Obama won or Trump lost \u2026 because both were losers\u2026 right?! So let us focus on the fact everything is going wrong today \u2013 except things always go wrong for conservatives."
