Some leading Democratic lawmakers this week called for suspending deportation proceedings against some legal immigrants who help run small businesses amid coronavirus pandemic chaos that threatens millions of American lives every day."

      "response": "\u201cHow can we fill the jobs gap with lower skilled people without making America less safe than before?\" \n\n\u00a0As soon as the news broke about Senate Republicans attempting to repeal Title 22 which provides access to food stamps by allowing states to cap benefits at 50 percent of poverty level household income instead of 70 percent would it be fair to say their agenda will keep many Americans hungry while also keeping our food supply stores open during these times when COVID still ravages us daily? And how do you know what good those job creation initiatives actually accomplish other then they allow corporations rather than individuals/families make money off them so no one can pay back taxes ever again nor take out student loans like everyone else should after college anyway?! They don't care because"

      "response": "Is there really an effective solution to filling state budget shortfalls caused mostly due to reduced tax revenue from high unemployment rates resulting from the Covid lockdowns, especially given the current public health crisis nationwide causing widespread business closures along with leaving thousands of unemployed workers unable to find new employment opportunities despite having completed postsecondary education and gaining valuable work experience through internship programs prior to graduating middle school let alone junior year! Why can we not simply stop sending students into debt only to receive nothing upon graduation except a diploma - all while simultaneously reducing healthcare spending significantly enough where Medicaid dollars could go towards treating actual medical conditions being treated currently by hospitals across the nation rather than just providing preventative screenings such as mammograms!? This whole problem does not exist until after someone graduates university,"

      "response": "immigration issue using specific examples related to the paragraph provided below...The answer is \"no\". I think this decision was made based solely on whether candidates had met the eligibility requirement set forth under DACA. The fact remains though that even here are several ways things did get better; e.g., family reunification improved dramatically since 2000; same goes refugees fleeing war zones specifically in Syria & Iraq throughout history ; refugee acceptance of Muslim claimants increased considerably over time too... But today's situation doesn't warrant further discussion unless absolutely necessary -- most often it is used merely as cheap political currency among opponents / populists whenever President Trump speaks up publicly concerning something he claims might cause harm."

      "response": "immigration regarding international debates around trade policy, border enforcement, asylum seekers etc.. Using facts, use statistics, citing historical trends (or any reputable sources) showing effects positive for certain demographics if illegal immigrants were removed from areas concerned by negative media attention. Provide reasons why others may disagree but maintain your point that undocumented aliens improve American economic life and free America its workforce via service provisioning created by the H1B visa program and legal worker visas... You must refute arguments against amnesty to stay relevant. If possible use personal anecdote telling the story of a real person whose life has been changed positively thanks to immigrant contributions, focusing on practical solutions NOT relying on xenophobic blame games demonizing noncitizens who live and work hard within US society."
