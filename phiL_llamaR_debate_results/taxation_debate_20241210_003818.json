      "response": "\"Should the USA change's taxation policy by implementing a progressive levy/tax?\" \n\n  a person may receive some benefits such as health care coverage which could reduce one's taxable income because individuals contribute towards healthcare costs; however taxes must also account for expenses incurred to cover these programs like Medicare etc., therefore making each taxpayer less likely to benefit directly despite having fewer dependents than others contributing towards the cost of public services provided via taxes since this will increase total expenditure per taxpayer whereas other countries manage without giving up anything personally beneficial but paying more overall for social service provisioning including education, law enforcement etc.; another possible solution might involve redistributive wealth sharing among different age classes so certain groups get better access to the resources available e.g."
