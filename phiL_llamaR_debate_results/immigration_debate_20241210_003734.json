      "response": "Are we being too soft on illegal immigrants? Do our current border enforcement methods actually work well enough to justify them? Is there a better way forward than just locking up every single person arrested by authorities if they happen to be undocumented? What about asylum seekers with legitimate claims but no place to go while waiting to have hearings before an official decides whether or not they can get into this country legally? How does one determine which claimants will likely succeed \u2014 based solely on evidence collected during their initial interviews without regard for how long such individuals might need to wait until hearing dates arrive? And even then, aren\u2019t some cases so desperate as to make everyone feel uncomfortable considering taking part? But let\u2019s say you do decide to allow all these refugees through anyway; shouldn"

      "response": "\"Should countries adopt less strict immigration policies?\" The answer would depend upon your position concerning safety concerns versus economic benefits\u2014the two seem often opposed, yet sometimes mutually reinforcing.. In other words, if someone doesn't care much about crime rates within his own community he may also want to believe the United States has lower murder rates overall compared to Canada, where he lives. On the opposite end of the scale, however, supporters of tighter control over entry cite statistics showing higher levels of homicide among Mexicans living abroad\u2026 Even though the media tend to exaggerate any news story going viral online \u2026 I don\u00b4t know why Democrats chose to focus only \u00a0on the fact that almost half of Americans agree Republicans were right last year regarding immigration."

It\u2019s also to give both sides a fair chance to respond reasonably rather than getting shouted-down by mob-like crowds full of people claiming to speak for millions. We\u2019ve seen examples of this behavior recently\u2014like Joe Biden calling Donald Trump a racist after weeks of him refusing to engage respectfully\u2014but it goes beyond politics and represents something deeper rooted in our culture."

Or consider detention centers that are filled with children from El Salvador and Honduras fleeing violence when parents cannot take custody because of criminal convictions or drug charges? Why do we keep letting convicted felons off? There isn\u2019t enough money available at present times to provide proper housing, food, healthcare, education, employment opportunities for each individual released back into society due to overcrowding caused by lack thereof! Instead they languish indefinitely behind bars awaiting trial..."
