      "response": "When does freedom end in self-destruction when liberty becomes tyranny? That question remains unresolved despite the best efforts of many people since the late 1700's\u2013most notably Thomas Jefferson \u2013to answer definitively using common sense reasoning based upon experience and knowledge from history (or lack thereof). This problem dates back centuries before 1776 though. It began long ago among individuals like Alexander Hamilton & John Adams, but soon became apparent everywhere through an extraordinary phenomenon known as groupthink. As noted well, this process occurs whenever too many people share a fixed worldview so much that all rational discussion inevitably dies out into utter chaos."

If yes, why did it shift? Share examples of changes in thought processes related to censorship.... The current debate focuses primarily around banning white supremacists and neo-Nazis from being able to post offensive material online because doing so could endanger innocent lives. Some argue against this ban claiming that such bans are unenforceable while others believe them necessary under the circumstances presented. We want to hear from you! Tell us what you think about either side of the argument."
