The answer could be an emphatic yes or no depending very much upon how one defines free speech. Most commonly used definitions tend not to include hate speech\u2014but when we do consider who counts among us those with whom it would be impossible to coexist peacefully without hurting them badly enough so they can hurt others back."

      "response": "\"Does anyone actually care about what will happen if we allow transgender athletes into elite sport?\" For starters, there are very few genuine arguments from either side other than one based solely on irrational fear; eerily similar fears were expressed by many years ago when gay baseball player Major League Baseball tried to enter the top leagues through biological sex reassignment surgery.. And while it was never explicitly stated during these debates then nor now does anyone claim that allowing GLSB players somehow threatens safety for everyone involved in playing baseball anymore because we all know someone has got their heart set on using her gender identity instead of womanhood for the purpose of living forever. It doesn't matter if she just wants to live longer anyway though since eventually death comes to everybody..."

      "response": "Should Women Athletes Play Men's Sports Too?, assuming neither position holds extreme views such as male chauvinism/transphobia etc., keeping in mind we're talking about American female professional soccer players competing against international teams and leagues established long before World War II!\nFirst off, let me start out saying I am definitely sympathetic toward the plight of women suffering due to sexism which still exists mostly within society despite decades of affirmative action measures aimed at helping create equality between genders. However, simply granting a hypothetical situation where every girl born today had been granted equal opportunities leading up until 1965 regardless of personal circumstances seems both unrealistic and unjustifiable morally."
