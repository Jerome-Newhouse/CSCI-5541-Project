      "response": "whether it is really too hard for Americans with limited education and skills \u2013 who are facing one of America\u2019s worst economic crises in decades because they cannot get decent jobs that bring enough money to meet their basic needs \u2013 to be made rich by being allowed to work without having earned any income at all. The question also relates directly to why Washington seems so desperate (and increasingly corrupt) about cutting taxes for everybody but the wealthy elite, even though studies have repeatedly shown how such policies harm middle class families as well; if you just want answers I suggest reading \u201cThe New Normal\u201d \u2014 a book that will probably change your perspective forever.."

If not then what does matter most now more than ever before\u2014is understanding people aren't stupid enough to let them vote themselves out of poverty! That could mean reducing government spending which would help many low\u2013middle\u2010class voters take back control over things like healthcare costs --or else it means making sure Republican representatives don't give away half\u00a0their electoral votes due\u00a0to some silly party ritual during the 2012 presidential election\u2026 And finally, GOP members might actually start listening to us instead of sitting around in meetings pontificating about something called a ``trillion dollar deficit''..."

Why did someone like Alexander Hamilton oppose the Second Amendment as part of his plan to create a national bank? To answer this question, consider both sides of today\u2019 swing states, including Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, Virginia, Mississippi, Arkansas, West Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee,... What happens after 2020, especially regarding abortion and gay marriage issues? While looking toward 2021, make predictions based upon current events happening in those states along with likely changes occurring afterward."

      "response": "Does anyone have any idea how much taxes America pays compared to other nations worldwide? Can you explain why American corporations are able to avoid having to pay their fair shares at all by using special legal tools... \n\n\tIn order to address your first prompt (How could Americans possibly justify excessive wealth accumulation if they paid less?), I personally believe that one way is for individuals who own large amounts of taxable income to use various methods such as utilizing trust funds created specifically for charitable purposes; donating money to nonprofit organizations thus effectively lowering overall taxes owed since donations will usually result in substantial tax deductions; setting up certain types of trusts whereby assets held for long periods of time generate annual interest payments rather than being taxed annually; selling off stocks, bonds, etc."

      "response": "taxation. Provide an argument against implementing either a greater high corporate tax rate or universal basic income regardless of personal economic status. Explain whether Democrats can be persuaded into supporting President Biden's proposal for free college education for young adults from middle class families even though many of these students received financial aid directly under existing programs already designed to support educational expenses for poor youth and working professionals alike.. Answer my second question concerning whether Democratic party leaders feel threatened when proposing policies put forth by Senator Bernie Sanders. Make note of anything that makes sense related to the left/progressive agenda versus the conservative/ libertarian stance."
