Some might argue that limiting access to certain views promotes more positive thought patterns, which could lead to greater empathy/understanding.\u00a0 Others may disagree because there has been evidence showing an increase in negative thinking after exposure to specific ideologies such as white nationalism/fascism. It also seems likely that many individuals who had previously experienced hateful rhetoric will continue engaging in similar behavior once removed from its influence. Additionally, those whose primary ideology was already based around exclusionary ideas like racism/nationalism might find themselves further isolated if they can no longer participate within the confines of racist/supremacist groups.\u00a0\u00a0\n2."

Bush as president (1965) during World War II, and Barack Obama after 9/11.. We shouldn't want American power reaching beyond its borders because then there will always come back home with some consequences you can't live with... What's more interesting though if the issue were gun control instead than foreign war powers\u2026 It wouldn\u2019t hurt just one little debate either since both sides seem so divided when it comes to this particular issue anyway."
