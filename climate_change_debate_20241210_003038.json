      "response": "Does Trump think global warming is real or does he know it\u2019s all just hype created by his own administration in order to justify increased military spending? Is there any chance that people who claim that natural cycles are responsible for current shifts may be aware they're only making matters worse (and their claims aren't always based on facts)? Are you sure scientists have been right about how much human activity has contributed to CO2 levels over the past century now since some politicians deny this reality as long as possible."

      "response": "Do we need a better answer than \u201cIt depends\u201d? Why do so many political leaders seem incapable of responding with an informed response rather than spouting rhetoric that sounds like gibberish. And why don\u2019t more intelligent minds make themselves heard when things get heated \u2014 especially if what they\u2019re saying will actually help the country move forward instead of taking us back into the dark ages."

      "response": "should the United States implement stronger laws against pollution caused by fossil fuel use such as oil drilling, coal mining etc., despite its impact on creating jobs\u2014particularly among communities where these industries play significant roles; and also consider the fact that most Americans believe in climate change but still support policies aimed at reducing green energy costs through subsidies which could hurt consumers\u2019 wallets while being good for business interests."

      "response": "Are our elected officials doing enough to address climate change? Or are they simply following orders from big corporate donors who stand to gain economically from continued reliance upon dirty fuels?\nThe Phi-lama left believes Congress needs to pass legislation curbing greenhouse gas emissions, including renewable electricity sources such as wind turbines, solar panels, biofuels made from plants like corn, algae and soybeans, biomass power stations burning wood chips and sawdust, nuclear reactors powered by uranium ore extracted deep underground without affecting nearby land resources like water supplies or farmland crops used to feed humans living near radioactive waste dumps released during accidents involving older designs of reactor technology dating before 1980s U.S."

      "response": "whether/when it is appropriate (and necessary) for the president to sign executive order imposing restrictions on carbon emission levels as well as regulations on hydraulic fracturing activity known collectively under the name \"fracking.\" These questions have been raised since President Obama took office four years ago via his signature legislative action, the Affordable Care Act aka Obamacare, which has helped reduce per capita health care spending by billions over time compared to similarly implemented measures around other developed countries -- particularly those having far lower life expectancies because their medical expenditures cover them all."

      "response": "Why do you agree with this point of view? What would be your response if another phi- left member offered a different argument? Why does one philosophy align better than others with your values? If we were talking about political candidates running for high-profile positions, what qualities would matter more \u2014 character or policy ideas? How can public debate help us understand differences between philosophies so that voters make informed decisions when choosing leaders."
